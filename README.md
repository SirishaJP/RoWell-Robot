# The RoWell Rescue Robot for Borewell Hazards
#### A project by Sirisha Jotheeswaran Padmasekhar 

## Why RoWell ? 
Borewell has been our major source of water since the time of 1990s. We as humans has evolved to find solutions to make use of resources the earth is willing to provide us or maybe even more at sometimes. But are we stuck in a cycle of finding solutions that then become the source of new problems? This project focuses on being an advocate to address the major social-issue that has raised in parts of the world. 

The portmanteau word "RoWell" derived from Robot-Borewell drives way to inculcate robot vision processing and integrate robotic learning to borewell systems. 

Due to negligence and ignorance, people forget to cover the boreholes after draining underground water and pulling out the pipes. The lack of knowledge
remains as the root cause of the problem. The recent statistics states that there are over 37 Million borewells in India and almost 70% of rescue operate fail. The death rate from 2015 to 2021 has accelerated. 

The objective of the research is to bridge the technological gap by adapting to Deep Learning Based Approach for the Rowell robot to explore any given environment, detect and classify high risk, low risk and safe borewells in real-time and alert the government officials to inspect and raise awareness to people in the community of high and low risk locations. Furthermore, integrating to Maps platforms allows us to locate borewells  in real-time. The current work focuses solely on the quote, "Prevention is better than cure".  

The Rowell  Robot is autonomous and Data-driven. The volatile nature of the
environment has raised concerns for its tediousness and lowered precision. The one stage
object detection method(s) are used to overcome these restrictions since they employ a single
neural network for both detection and classification which is faster and significantly accurate
compared to traditional two-way object detection methods.

The requirement matrix (reference/requirement matrix.jpg) allows us to evaluate one stage detector algorithms with our metrics. On evaluation Yolov3, yolov5, yolov7, efficientDet and ResNet is the best algorithms for performance evaluation. 
The algorithms  are comparatively been able to perform the tasks with accuracy and precision, and is cost effective, utilizes wide angle vision to detect small objects and can detect borewells in real-time which allows us to deploy our project with utmost efficiency. 

This project focuses on the following:

1. Train one stage detector models to detect and classify borewells and evaluate the performance ratio. 
2. Integration of maps using GoogleMaps API. 
3. Set up email alert system using Zoho mails API. 
4. Set up whatsapp alert system using Twilio API. 




## Acknowledgements

 I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my primary supervisor Prof.Mr.Sreeganesh thottempudi (Professor at SRH University of applied sciences) and my secondary supervisor Mr. Adithya Mohan, (Robotic Engineer at Quantum Systems GmBH) who has helped me every step of the way in providing the resources and support needed to implement my learning from Masters degree in Big data and artificial Intelligence, which allowed me to successful complete my Dissertation. In addition, I would like to thank, the administration, examination board and other faculty of the university who has answered to my queries with dedication and patience.    
 Lastly, this endeavor would'nt have been possible without the support of my parents and siblings who have always motivated me to acheive my goals.

## API Reference

The general rule of thumb is to not share API Key in code or other sources. Eventhough, the API Key is provided in the source code, the API keys are re-generated to protect critical information from public. 

Steps to create API key for Google Maps API : 

 1. Open Google Maps Platform
 2. On the Credentials page, click Create credential â†’ API key.
 3. API Key is successfully generated.
 4. Use the unique API Key to configure Google Maps.


 Create Authentication Token (OAuth) Token for Zoho Mail API: 


1. Create a personal account on Zoho Mail
2. Login with your credentials
3. Fill API key registration form
4. Click the "Generate API Key" button.
5. Zoho mail API Key is successfully generated.
